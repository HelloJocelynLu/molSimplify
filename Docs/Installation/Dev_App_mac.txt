Otherwise, packaging a script in a .app bundle is trivial. Mac OS X will happily run any script identified as the application's executable.

You need to have this file structure in place:

    Wrapper.app
        Contents
            Info.plist
            MacOS
                MyScript

Files in italic are actual files, the rest are directories.

Only one entry is required in Info.plist, and it's the one that identifies MyScript as the application's executable:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>CFBundleExecutable</key>
    <string>MyScript</string>
</dict>
</plist>
