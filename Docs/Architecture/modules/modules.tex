\section{Classes}
\subsection{\texttt{atom3D.py}}
This file defines a custom atom class named atom3D. Each object has the following attributes: mass, atomic number, covalent radius, 3D coordinates and symbol.  
\subsubsection{\_\_init\_\_()}
This is the constructor of the class the takes as arguments the symbol and the 3D coordinates of the atom. It pulls the atomic mass from a database included in \texttt{globalvars.py} and if it doesn't find the corresponding atomic symbol in the database it assumes a carbon atom. 

\subsubsection{coords()}
Returns a list with the 3D coordinates of the atom.

\subsubsection{distance()}
Calculates the distance with another atom in 3D space.

\subsubsection{distancev()}
Returns the difference vector with respect to another atom in 3D space.
